# Pokedex
During my 4th grade, I had to develop a server in nodeJS that stores elements of a JSON file. Those elements are the first 130 pokemon and their characteristics. The frontend is implemented with Vuetify.

How to use the application:

launch the server "servers.js" with the command "node servers.js" or "nodemon server.js".
Open the file index.html on your web browser.
Have fun.
